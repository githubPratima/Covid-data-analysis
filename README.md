Data Source: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus
This project seeks to perform a thorough analysis of COVID-19 insights by employing data visualization and analytical techniques. Through the utilization of tools like Power BI, the goal is to unveil meaningful patterns, trends, and implications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis will delve into various aspects such as total cases, confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths by country, confirmed count by country, date-wise, along mobility trends. Leveraging Power BI's data modeling and transformation capabilities, the collected data will undergo processing and transformation into a standardized format for in-depth analysis. The project outcomes are anticipated to yield valuable insight into the evolving dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.
